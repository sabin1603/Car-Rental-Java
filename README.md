# Car-Rental-Java

I designed and built a Java app for managing the reservation details for a car rental company. 
- the program allows multiple operations for cars, reservations and customers
- data can be retrieved from text files, binary files or a relational database; using *settings.properties*, the user can decide which file they want the data regarding cars, customers and reservations to be retrieved from
- I used JavaFX for the program's GUI.
- I used jdbc sqlite for working with the relational database
